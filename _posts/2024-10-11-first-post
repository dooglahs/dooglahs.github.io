# First Post

It's always about the first post.

I have lately been working on SQL queries for `osquery` (we're using the Kolide flavor). I also am often writing small script bits for my workplace's Mosyle instance to get things done.

I'm sure there will be more but that's it for now. Depending, I might even reconsitute my whole prior blog. It would be something nice to have back.
